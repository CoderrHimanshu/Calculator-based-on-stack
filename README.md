# Calculator-based-on-stack

This is a command based calculator based on basic operations of stack.
Basically it takes a string input as (23+5)*(4-2.5)+6/3
which is further converted into a pseudo infix  as (a+b)*(c-d)+e/f
Numbers are stored as alphabets because computer read 23 as 2 & 3 so converting to postfix is difficult
after converting to postfix it calculates the expression by performing basic push and pop operations.
